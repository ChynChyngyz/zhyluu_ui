  "ceiling_title": "Ceiling-to-Wall Connection",
  "ceiling_description": "Another place where thermal bridges are often found is the connection between the ceiling and the wall in the so-called ring beam.\nHowever, in older buildings, this problem occurs much more frequently, especially after replacing old, leaky wooden windows with PVC ones. Moisture can accumulate in these areas, and mold or even fungus may appear. This is all due to the joint between the floor slab and the outer edge of the wall. Fortunately, the thermal bridge here can be eliminated by carefully aligning the slab joint with the edge of the wall.",

  "windows_doors_description_part1": "Other critical points of heat leakage are windows and doors in external walls, especially lintels and direct connections of the window to the building wall.\nHeat loss through a window occurs through several channels: loss through the window unit and frames (thermal bridges, leaks), loss due to air thermal conductivity and convective flows between the panes, as well as heat loss through thermal radiation. Obviously, the amount of heat loss through the window unit directly depends on the window design, materials used, and manufacturing quality. In reality, it accounts for about 10% of the total heat loss from the room. The other two channels of heat loss are losses directly through the glazing.\n\nAssessing whether the work was done correctly in this case is quite difficult.\nIf errors are visible, we can minimize heat loss at the joints using so-called warm window installation using tapes and sealing foil.\nFor more details about window and door insulation, you can study the section ",

  "wall_title": "Walls",
  "wall_description_main": "Walls are one of the main sources of heat loss, accounting for approximately 35% of total heat loss. This occurs due to the thermal conductivity of wall materials and possible defects such as cracks or loose sealing.\nThis happens due to the thermal conductivity of the materials the walls are made of and the presence of possible defects that can contribute to heat leakage.\n\nSome building materials have higher thermal conductivity, making them less effective as thermal insulation. Materials such as brick, concrete, or metal can be less insulating than special materials designed for insulation, such as mineral wool or expanded polystyrene.\nDefects in walls, such as cracks, gaps, or loose sealing, can also lead to heat leakage through the walls. This can occur due to insufficient density between material joints or due to wall damage resulting from aging, weather conditions, or construction errors.\nTo reduce heat loss through walls, it is necessary to pay attention to their thermal insulation. Installing high-quality insulation, repairing defects, eliminating gaps, and sealing joints will help significantly reduce heat loss and increase the energy efficiency of the building. It is also worth considering that high-quality wall thermal insulation will help improve indoor comfort, prevent condensation, and save on heating and cooling costs.\nDetailed information on wall insulation methods can be found in the section ",

  "roof_title": "Heat loss through the roof of the building",
  "roof_description_1": "Approximately 25-30% of total heat loss occurs through the roof. This is another frequent location for thermal bridges in houses. Typically, heat leaks in attics and lofts arise from improper thermal insulation connections between the external walls and the roof structure.",
  "roof_reasons_title": "There are many reasons for this:",
  "roof_reason_1": "Warm air always rises to the ceiling, so the greatest temperature difference occurs at the roof. Without reliable thermal insulation, energy leaves the house without any obstacles.",
  "roof_reason_2": "Check the integrity and thickness of the roof floor, paying special attention to the areas adjacent to the walls.",
  "roof_reason_3": "Roofs often leak: if water drips from the ceiling, it is the first sign that the insulation is absorbing water and getting wet (as a result, heat leaves very quickly).",
